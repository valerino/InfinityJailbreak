* NOTE: As of 31/10/2014, my tests shows that now they implemented checks correctly (serverside, as it * 
* should always been) so this hack can't work anymore :(                                               *
* i only investigated barely, just for the 'number of authorized *devices' check since i've bought     *
* another mobilephone, but that seems the issue.                                                       *
*                                                                                                      *
* I leave the code here for historical purposes, so :)                                                 *

Android XPosedFramwework module to remove stupid pseudo-DRM from InfinityTV Android application 
(you buy it, you watch it everywhere/on every device).

NOTE: THIS IS NOT TO WATCH INFINITY TV WITHOUT A REGULAR SUBSCRIPTION, IT JUST REMOVES SOME OF THE DRM LIMITATIONS.

Usage:
. Install XposedFramework on your rooted device (if you don't know what it is, this tool isn't for you)

. Install the provided APK / recompile it using Android Studio (don't ask me how, google it)

. Enable the Xposed module and reboot the device. 
  Magolamagamagia(tm), InfinityTv now runs on a rooted device aswell, 
  you can download content from every device(Tablet/Smartphone) on every kind of network (3G/WIFI), 
  you can watch InfinityTv from everywhere(not only from Italy)

yours truly,
valerino
